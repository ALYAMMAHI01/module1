Why we use python? 
• simple and readable syntax (easy to learn) 
• Works for many fields: web, data science, AI, automation, games, etc. 
• Huge community and library support • Faster development time compared to low-level languages 
Advantages: 
1. Easy to learn and read • Syntax is close to English • Fewer lines of code • print("Hello, World!") 
2. Versatile (Multi-Purpose) • Web development (Django, Flask) • Data science & AI (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow) 
• Automation & scripting 
• Machine learning 
• Game development 
• Cybersecurity 
3. Large Library Ecosystem 
• Thousands of built-in and third-party libraries 
• Saves time and effort 
4. Cross-Platform 
• Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux without changes 
5. Strong Community Support 
• Easy to find help, tutorials, and documentation 
6. Rapid Development •
 Faster coding → faster testing faster deployment 
 Disadvantages: 
 1. Slower Execution Speed 
 • Interpreted language 
 • Slower than C, C++, or Java for performance-critical tasks 2
 . High Memory Usage • Uses more memory than low-level languages 
 3. Not Ideal for Mobile Apps 
 • Rarely used for Android or iOS native apps 
 4. Runtime Errors •
  Errors appear while running the program (not before) 5
  . Weak in Low-Level Programming 
  • Not suitable for OS kernels or device drivers Summary: Python is used because it is easy to learn, readable, and versatile. It helps developers build programs quickly for web development, data science, AI, and automation.
   Advantages: 
   • Simple and beginner-friendly • Supports many applications 
   • Large libraries and strong community 
   • Works on all platforms Disadvantages: •
    Slower than some other languages • Uses more memory 
    • Not ideal for mobile apps or low-level programming Overall: Python is best for fast development and learning, but not for high-performance or system-level tasks. What is pseudocode? Pseudocode is an informal, human-readable description of an algorithm. It looks like code, but it is not tied to any specific programming language. I ts goal is to explain logic and steps clearly before actual coding. Why we use pseudocode 
    • To plan the solution before writing real code • To communicate logic between people (even non-programmers) 
    • To avoid syntax errors and focus on thinking 
    • To convert easily into any programming language later Example Pseudocode to implement reading a file : # Start the program BEGIN # Define the file name SET fileName ← "data.txt" #Open the file in read mode OPEN fileName FOR reading # Check if the file exists IF file does not exist THEN PRINT "Error: File not found" END IF WHILE NOT end of file DO # Read the file line by line READ one line from file #Process or display each line PRINT the line END WHILE # Close the file CLOSE file # End the program END Notes 
    • Keywords like BEGIN, IF, WHILE are conceptual, not real syntax •
     You can later convert this easily to Python, Java, C++, etc. Convert to python: #with open(...) automatically closes the file #strip() removes extra spaces/new lines #try / except handles file errors safely file_name = "data.txt" try: with open(file_name, "r") as file: for line in file: print(line.strip()) except FileNotFoundError: print("Error: File not found") python matches to pseudocode: Pseudocode Step Python Implementation OPEN file for reading open(file_name, "r") IF file not exist except FileNotFoundError WHILE not end of file for line in file READ one line line CLOSE file Automatically handled by with
